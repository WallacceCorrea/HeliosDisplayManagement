> 3. Execute the program and wait for it to end, then press Enter to exit.
> 5. This will generate a log file right next to the program, rename this newly created log file from "HeliosDisplayManagement.Reporting.XXXXX.log" to a meaningful name, for example: "DisabledSurround.log" or "AllMonitorsExtended.log" so I know what the log is about.
